            Hello, my name is Patrick Gerspach and welcome to my portfolio site!
            I am an aspiring web developer/software engineer who has completely
            changed the course of his life in pursuit of a more fulfilling and
            enjoyable career.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began coding at the University of Notre Dame, where I studied
            mechanical engineering. My experience started with learning the
            basics of an archaic programming language called Fortran. From
            there, pieces of coding began to slip into my coursework through
            MatLAB and C, and it didn't take me long to desire to learn more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon finishing my degree and starting work, I almost immediately
            signed up for the Columbia University Engineering Coding Boot Camp,
            which I am set to graduate in March. I have learned an incredible
            amount in such a short time, and my interest has only grown since
            the onset of my journey. I hope you enjoy browsing my projects as
            much as I enjoyed working on them!

          <p>
            Countless hours of deliberate practice coupled with recreational
            coding has equipped me with a substantial set of skills. Front-end
            to back-end, my abilities cover a very wide range of capability,
            while my curiosity and determination cover whatever remains. Web
            apps, computer apps, data storage, data analysis - you name it and
            I'm up for the challenge.

          <p>
            A graduate of Notre Dame, I am a die-hard Irish fan and an avid
            follower of college football. So, when thinking of ideas for
            projects, my mind naturally turns to sports statistics and,
            specifically, CFB.
          </p>
          <p>
            For one of my personal projects, I decided to work on analyzing a
            team's recruiting against it success on the field, which is
            discussed more below.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="portStart portStart2 row">
        <div class="column secondProjPic">
          <a href="https://github.com/pgerspach/recruit" target="blank"
            ><img
              id="ndPlot"
              class="recruitPic"
              src="assets/images/ndrecruit.png"
          /></a>
        </div>
        <div class="column recruitDesc">
          <p>
            The first order of business for this project was gathering the data.
            I decided to scrape rivals.com for the recruiting data, and
            teamrankings.com for the win/loss records data.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            I wanted to test my regular expression skills on this project, and
            so I scraped all the data with vanilla regex. This proved
            challenging, but incredibly rewarding when everything worked. For
            loading the html, I used npm request for teamrankings.com, while I
            was forced to used phantom.js for rivals.com as their content
            populates after the page loads.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Once I gather the data, I write it all into a JSON file which is
            read by my server. The server sets up the routes, and provides all
            of the team names to the front end to create the dropdown menu. The
            front end then posts which team it wants data for, and the back end
            responds with all the data which is graphed using plotly.js.

          />
          <p>
            Like a lot of people, I love being silly and joking around with
            friends and family. When people are free to be themselves around
            people close to them, I find that there is always something
            hilarious said. At the same time, I really love the other impacts that
            words have on us- they can inspire, elate, anger, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, I began creating Quote, which is described below.

            Quote is a full stack project I've been working on for just a few
            weeks now. The idea is to be a dedicated and intimate platform for
            sharing moments through quotes. Friends can post things said by
            their friends either publicly or in groups, and have them approved
            or denied. Approved quotes land on the speaker's own quote page.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Node.js and Express.js are used to set up the server and routing,
            while Sequelize.js is used with MySQL to store user information.
            User authentication is done through Google Firebase, which also
            provides the uuid for accessing database information. Finally,
            Handlebars is used to render the HTML.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This project is a work in progress and changes every day. I will
            attempt to keep this page as updated as I can and will post the link
            when I first push it to heroku!
